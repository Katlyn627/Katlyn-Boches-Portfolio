          I am a Colorado Native and current student at the University of Denver
          Full-stack coding bootcamp. In my free time I enjoy learning new
          skills and working on personal goals and helping my community. I enjoy
          hiking, camping and paddleboarding and am currently learning American
          sign language and lyra hoop, in my fitness classes. I enjoy spending
          time with family and friends playing board and games like chess, and
          cribbage.

          After graduating from culinary school with a Bachelor's of Science in
          Food Service Management I decided on broadening my horizons and seeing
          the world. I am a travel enthusiast with skills in business,
          marketing, and computer programming. I spent the next 10 years
          traveling both internationally and the United States getting a variety
          of experince in different jobs, that have given my a wealth of
          knowledge in both business and customer service as well as
          hospitality. I am eager to get started with my career in this field, I
          am looking to use my skills to start a successful career in the
          Computer Programming Industry.
